            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Five Four + Marvel Collection</h1><p>Some comic book apparel can end up juvenile, but the new Five Four collaboration with Marvel is anything but. In celebration of the impending release of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Five Four subscription menswear service finds subtlety in the generally loud graphic medium by using Marvel's famous roster of superheroes to inspire its April capsule.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c00f82bc7a96b03780b683692320bb03f3b031f2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Interview: Artist Ryan McGinness on Designing for Hennessy</h1><p>Despite the fact that he works across multiple artistic mediums, it's very easy to discern the work of NYC-based artist Ryan McGinness. In addition to his iconic symbol-driven body of work, his experimental Instagram and the depths of his oftentimes ornate paintings, McGinness recently took to designing a special limited edition bottle for luxury cognac brand Hennessy.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b0177dec01e85895d69f554c2d73fc2a73857261.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>
